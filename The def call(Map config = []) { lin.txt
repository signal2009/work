The def call(Map config = [:]) { line defines a Groovy method named call. This method takes a single parameter, which is a Map named config with a default value of an empty map ([:]). Here's a breakdown of what this method is likely intended to do:

Parameters:

Map config: This parameter allows the method to receive a map of configuration options. The = [:] sets a default value of an empty map in case the method is called without providing any arguments.
Method Body:

The body of the call method is not provided in your snippet, so I'll describe the common pattern used in Jenkins shared pipeline libraries.
Configuration Options:

The config map typically contains various configuration options that control the behavior of the pipeline. These options might include things like application name, deployment environment, paths to configuration files, etc.
Pipeline Execution:

The call method is often used as the entry point for pipeline execution. When the pipeline is invoked, the call method is executed, and the provided config map is used to customize the pipeline's behavior based on the provided configuration.
Customization and Reusability:

Defining a call method with a map parameter allows users of the shared library to customize the pipeline by passing different configuration options. This promotes reusability as the same pipeline script can be adapted for different projects or scenarios.
Here's a simplified example to illustrate the concept:

groovy
Copy code
def call(Map config = [:]) {
    // Extract configuration options
    def appName = config.appName ?: "defaultAppName"
    def environment = config.environment ?: "dev"

    // Rest of the pipeline script using appName and environment variables
    pipeline {
        // ...
    }
}
In this example, the call method takes a config map, extracts the appName and environment options (with default values if not provided), and then uses these options to customize the pipeline's behavior. The pipeline can now be invoked with different configurations:

groovy
Copy code
myPipelineScript([
    appName: "myCustomApp",
    environment: "prod"
])
This provides a way to reuse the same pipeline script with different configurations. The exact use of the call method depends on the conventions and requirements of the Jenkins shared library it belongs to.





The appName and contextRoot variables are defined to provide configurable parameters for the Jenkins pipeline. These parameters allow for flexibility in the deployment process and make the pipeline script reusable for different applications and contexts. Let's break down their purposes:

appName Variable:

appName represents the name of the application being built and deployed. It is used in various places throughout the pipeline script, such as setting environment variables, defining parameters for scanning tools (Checkmarx, Black Duck), and as part of the XL Deploy package ID.
contextRoot Variable:

contextRoot represents the context root or path for the application within the deployment environment. It is also used in setting environment variables, defining XL Deploy application folders, and potentially other deployment-related configurations.
By defining these variables as parameters, you can customize the deployment process for different applications or contexts without modifying the main body of the pipeline script. When calling the runMavenMultiBranchJobTemplate function or the main call function, you can pass different values for appName and contextRoot based on the specific requirements of the application or environment.

For example, if you have multiple applications that follow a similar CI/CD process but have different names or deployment paths, you can reuse the same pipeline script by providing different values for appName and contextRoot. This makes the pipeline script more versatile and adaptable to various projects within the organization.
