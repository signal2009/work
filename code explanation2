ServerName = ($RDataSqlServer | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq $RDataSqlServer }).Name   what is the output of the server name
ChatGPT
It appears there's an issue with the provided PowerShell command. The Where-Object clause is attempting to filter based on the Name property of $RDataSqlServer, but the comparison is against the entire $RDataSqlServer variable, not individual elements.

Assuming you want to retrieve the Name property of a specific SQL Server instance based on its name, you should adjust the command like this:

powershell
Copy code
$ServerName = ($RDataSqlServer | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "sql-tripos-lab-cwam7rbx6nlve" }).Name
Replace "sql-tripos-lab-cwam7rbx6nlve" with the specific SQL Server instance name you are interested in. This command will filter $RDataSqlServer based on the specified instance name and then retrieve the Name property of that instance.

If you provide a specific SQL Server instance name, I can help you modify the command accordingly.
