mvn test and npm audit are commands used in different ecosystems for different purposes:

mvn test (Maven):

Purpose: The mvn test command is used in Maven, a build automation and project management tool primarily for Java projects.
Functionality: It runs the unit tests defined in the project. These tests are typically written using testing frameworks such as JUnit or TestNG.
Key Points:
Validates code integrity by executing unit tests.
Commonly used in Java projects to ensure that code changes do not introduce new bugs.
Integrates with the Maven build lifecycle.
npm audit (npm - Node Package Manager):

Purpose: The npm audit command is used in npm, which is the package manager for JavaScript and Node.js projects.
Functionality: It checks the project's dependencies for known security vulnerabilities. It provides a summary of vulnerabilities and suggests solutions, such as updating packages to versions with security patches.
Key Points:
Focused on identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
Useful for ensuring that the project does not include packages with known security issues.
Part of the npm security features for package management in JavaScript and Node.js projects.
In summary, while mvn test is primarily focused on running unit tests in Java projects using Maven, npm audit is focused on identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in the dependencies of JavaScript and Node.js projects managed by npm. They serve different purposes and are part of the testing and security practices within their respective ecosystems. It's common to use both commands in their respective contexts to ensure code quality and security in multi-language projects.
